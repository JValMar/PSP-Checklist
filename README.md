CHECKLIST PROPOSAL:  PATIENT SAFETY PROJECTS ADEQUACY 
Version: 17/07/2025
This is a draft proposal, based on the keynote of this workshop and some ideas get from PS & QI tools. 
Please, feel free to suggest any issues to clarify or complete this checklist: jvmartin@us.es 

This checklist evaluates the comprehensive considerations required to advance patient safety (PS) at the hospital level, ensuring alignment with international standards while adapting to local realities.

Note: Regularly review progress with this checklist, adapting as new challenges and opportunities arise, and ensure culturally sensitive, locally driven, and sustainable improvement.

1. LEADERSHIP & GOVERNANCE:
•	[ ] Are hospital directors and clinical leaders visibly supporting PS initiatives?
•	[ ] Is there a designated PS officer or committee with clear roles and authority?
•	[ ] Are local, national, and international policies integrated into project goals?
•	[ ] Are local leaders empowered to make decisions regarding PS strategies?
•	[ ] Is stakeholder engagement inclusive (e.g., patients, families, community reps)?

2. RESOURCES & CAPACITY:
•	[ ] Has an infrastructure and budget assessment been conducted?
•	[ ] Are essential resources (IT, reporting tools, safe medicine storage, utilities) available?
•	[ ] Is staffing adequate, and is there protected time for QI or PS activities?
•	[ ] Are standardized, up-to-date protocols available and in use?
•	[ ] Does staff receive continuous, multi-modal PS training (onsite, simulation, e-learning)?
•	[ ] Are train-the-trainer or mentorship models implemented to build local capacity? 
3. BASELINE ASSESSMENT:
•	[ ] Has the hospital assessed its PS culture using validated tools?
•	[ ] Are staff (managers, clinicians) and patients aware and engaged in PS?
•	[ ] Are lessons from previous improvement projects systematically reviewed and applied?
•	[ ] Have local PS indicators been defined, and are they benchmarked against peers?
•	[ ] Are best and worst practices within the hospital identified and shared?
•	[ ] Is workload (risk of staff overload) regularly monitored and managed?
•	[ ] Are staff attitudes/technical and personal inertia assessed and addressed?
 
4. INTERVENTION DESIGN & IMPLEMENTATION:
•	[ ] Is the project structure clearly defined (committees, multidisciplinary teams)?
•	[ ] Are processes mapped and revised using QI methods (e.g., PDCA cycles)?
•	[ ] Are interventions tailored to local context (fit, acceptability, appropriateness)?
•	[ ] Are training and capacity-building methods diverse (workshops, simulation, online, role play)?
•	[ ] Is mentorship or peer coaching included?
•	[ ] Is there realistic, phased planning with achievable milestones?
•	[ ] Are all relevant professional groups (clinical, admin, pharmacy, patients) engaged?
•	[ ] Are outcome and process indicators (error rates, satisfaction) defined and tracked?
 
5. CHANGE MANAGEMENT:
•	[ ] Is ongoing support from leadership and institutions visible (resources, recognition)?
•	[ ] Are patients and families actively involved (committees, feedback, co-design)?
•	[ ] Are PS indicators regularly monitored and published?
•	[ ] Are there reliable feedback mechanisms (meetings, bulletins, dashboards, incentives)?
•	[ ] Is improvement recognized and celebrated (internal awards, sharing success stories)?
•	[ ] Are setbacks openly discussed for collective learning? 
6. SUSTAINABILITY & INSTITUTIONALIZATION:
•	[ ] Are training, QI activities, and PS roles included in job descriptions and budgets?
•	[ ] Are PS activities codified in hospital governance and linked to accreditation?
•	[ ] Is there ongoing monitoring of key PS indicators, with accessible reporting?
•	[ ] Are lessons learned documented to facilitate staff orientation and project continuity?
•	[ ] Are feedback loops established allowing innovative, adaptive improvement?
•	[ ] Has the hospital developed a long-term plan to maintain resources post-initiative? 
7. CROSS-LEARNING, PARTNERSHIPS & KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER:
•	[ ] Are there peer-to-peer learning mechanisms (cross-audits, shared training, collaboratives)?
•	[ ] Is horizontal learning prioritized over top-down mandates (especially with external partners)?
•	 [ ] Are knowledge-exchange sites (digital dashboards, communities of practice) active?
•	[ ] There are considered other actions to disseminate changes (locally & globally): reports, scientific communications, etc.?
•	[ ] Are regional, national and/or international alliances with other partners to impulse the strength and impact of this project?
